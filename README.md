# Dice-Roll-
This Dice Game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allows two players to roll dice by clicking a button. The dice images update randomly to show numbers 1 to 6, and the winner is determined based on the higher roll. The game has a clean, responsive design and includes footer links to social media platforms for further engagement.
